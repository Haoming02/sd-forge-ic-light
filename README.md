# SD Forge IC-Light
This is an Extension for the [Forge Webui](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge), which implements [IC-Light](https://github.com/lllyasviel/IC-Light), allowing you to manipulate the illumination of images.

> This does **not** work with [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

<h1 align="center">W.I.P</h1>

## Getting Started
1. Download the **2** models from [Releases](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-forge-ic-light/releases)
2. Create a new folder, `ic-light`, inside your webui `models` folder
3. Place the 2 models inside said folder
4. **(Optional)** You can rename the models, as long as the filenames contain either **`fc`** or **`fbc`**
